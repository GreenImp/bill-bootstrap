# Bill - a front-end HTML/CSS bootstrap

This is a bootstrap for use developing dynamic front-end web applications.
It utilises bits from various different existing bootstraps, CSS resets and other such things and combines them into something ideal for my own uses.

## Files

The files found under '/reference/' are exactly what the name suggests, reference material. These are bits of code that I am using to help build my bootstrap, but will not actually be included.

The actual files to use are under '/assets/'.

The 'test.html' file can be used to test any bits of the bootstrap that you like.
