# Bill - a front-end HTML/CSS bootstrap

This is a bootstrap for use developing dynamic front-end web applications.

It utilises bits from various different existing bootstraps, CSS resets and other such things (such as .htaccess and robot.txt files) and combines them into something ideal for my own uses.

## Files
### Reference
The files found under '/reference/' are exactly what the name suggests, reference material. These are bits of code that I am using to help build the bootstrap, but will not actually be included in the release.

Please don't modify the files here, I want them to be the original references for the different frameworks.

### Source
The files under '/src/' are the development 'source' files.

It contains all of the original un-compressed files, such as SASS files.

### Distribution
The '/dist/' directory contains the actual distribution ready files.
Once source files have benn modified and changes accepted, they will be copied across to their relevant location in the '/dist/' directory.

All SASS files will be pre-compiled into CSS before-hand and js should be minified.


## Testing
The 'test.html' file (in the root) can be used to test any bits of the bootstrap that you like.
